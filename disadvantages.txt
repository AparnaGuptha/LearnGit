3.2 DISADVANTAGE OF EXISITING SYSTEM 

a) Because we use K-means algorithm: 
I. Difficult to predict K-Value.
II. With global cluster, it didn't work well. 
III. Different initial partitions can result in different final clusters.
IV. It does not work well with clusters (in the original data) of Different size and Different density.
b) Because we use decision tree algorithm: 
I.A small change in the data can cause a large change in the structure of the decision tree causing instability. 
II. For a Decision tree sometimes calculation can go far more complex compared to other algorithms.
 III. Decision tree often involves higher time to train the model.
 IV. Decision tree training is relatively expensive as the complexity and time has taken are more.
V. The Decision Tree algorithm is inadequate for applying regression and predicting continuous values.
